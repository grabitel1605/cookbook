Notes:
  Most of what software does is the following:
    1.) Take some kind of input from a person.
    2.) Change it.
    3.) Print out something to show how it changed.

  Functions do three things:
    1. They name pieces of code the way variables name strings and numbers.
    2. They take arguments the way your scripts take argv.
    3. Using 1 and 2, they let you make your own ”mini-scripts” or ”tiny commands.”
